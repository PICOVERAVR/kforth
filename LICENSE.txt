This code was translated to x86_64 by Kyle W. Neil, and is built on Jonesforth by Richard W. M. Jones.

To be nice and fair to everyone, here is the license put in the original Jonesforth forth interpreter:

	I, the copyright holder of this work, hereby release it into the public domain. This applies worldwide.
	
	In case this is not legally possible, I grant any entity the right to use this work for any purpose,
	without any conditions, unless such conditions are required by law.

A copy of the version of jonesforth that I translated is also included.
